# discord-site-ddos-poc
A proof of concept for ddosing/dossing websites by abusing Discord embeds.

I am not responsible what you do with this.

# Using this tool
In order to use this tool you simply have to create a server and make tons of channels using a selfbot. After that simply run `python3 run.py`, set your target, run `!troll` and just sit there and think about your life decisions. (Ofcourse running after you invite the bot.)
